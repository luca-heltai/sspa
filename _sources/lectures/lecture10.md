# Lecture 10 — Parallel Performance Lab & Wrap-up (3h)

Objectives

- Run practical parallel experiments (e.g., Monte Carlo π)
- Measure runtimes, compute speedup and efficiency
- Prepare final mini-project deliverables and next steps

Content summary

Hands-on lab: serial and parallel implementations (Python multiprocessing, optional C++/OpenMP). Collect timings for 1,2,4,... cores, tabulate speedup, and analyze results vs theoretical expectations. Course summary and integration of tools.
