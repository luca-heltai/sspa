# Lecture 9 — Parallel Computing Concepts (3h)

Objectives

- Define speedup and efficiency; strong vs weak scaling
- Apply Amdahl’s Law and Gustafson’s Law to examples
- Interpret timing data and identify scaling bottlenecks

Content summary

Theory of speedup: definitions and worked examples. Discuss profiling and where serial fractions arise. Numerical examples illustrating Amdahl and Gustafson interpretations.
