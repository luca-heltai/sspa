# SSPA — Scientific Software Tools & Parallel Algorithms

Welcome to the course materials for SSPA (2025). This Jupyter Book collects lecture notes, examples, and exercises covering:

```{include} ../README.md
```

Use the table of contents to navigate the 10 sessions (each ~3h). See the top-level repository README for quick setup instructions.

Below is a quick summary of the course topics collected in this Jupyter Book:

- Unix shell and HPC environments (Slurm)
- Version control with Git
- Documentation (Doxygen, Sphinx)
- Testing (gtest, pytest)
- Containerization (Docker, Apptainer)
- Continuous Integration (GitHub Actions)
- Parallel algorithms and performance analysis

Use the table of contents to navigate the 10 sessions (each ~3h). The repository `README.md` is included above to avoid duplication — update the single README to change both the repository landing page and the book index.
